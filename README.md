The issues are usually a good place to find something to contribute to.
Feel free to suggest your ideas, though.

### How it works

This repository contains the source of the browser extension along with a few other things.
Here is an introduction to each of the packages:

- `packages/extension`: code for the browser extension.
- `packages/gh-pages`: the website used to be hosted on GitHub, before I bought the xgp.community domain. The `games.json` file is still served that way to not break the extension for previous users.
- `packages/scripts`: contains scripts that are usually run through GitHub actions.
- `packages/types`: contains types that are shared across the packages.
- `packages/xgp.community`: contains the source of the website.
