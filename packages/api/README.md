# api

This package contains the source of the GitHub page and the "api" (it really is just a json file).

## `static/games.json`

The file `static/games.json` contains the list of games included with the Xbox Game Pass.
The list is generated by scrapping information from the Xbox Game Pass' website, see `scripts/fetchGame.ts`.
It's using Puppeteer and prints a few useful information to make sure it was able to fetch all the games' data.

So in order to update the list of games, you have to run `npm run scrapGames`.
